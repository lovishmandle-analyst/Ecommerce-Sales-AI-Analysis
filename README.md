# Ecommerce-Sales-AI-Analysis This project was designed to replicate a real-world e-commerce analytics workflow, where raw transactional data is transformed into strategic business insights. The objective was not just dashboard creation, but building a decision-support system that answers why performance changes, what drives revenue, and where optimization is required.

### 📊 Live Dashboard

## Tools & Stack Used
1. MySQL – Data extraction, transformation, modeling, and performance-optimized querying
2. Tableau – KPI frameworks, interactive dashboards, and insight storytelling
3. AI Assistance – SQL logic validation, query optimization, and KPI definition
 
## End-to-End Analytical Workflow
## 1.Data Modeling & SQL Analytics (MySQL) with AI 
a. From an analyst’s standpoint, my first priority was data reliability and structure, Profiled the data to understand transaction volume, revenue  distribution, and customer behavior Cleaned and standardized fields to ensure analytical accuracy
b. Designed SQL queries using joins, aggregations, and subqueries to create analysis-ready datasets
c. Optimized queries for scalability and dashboard performance
4. AI was leveraged to validate complex SQL logic and ensure KPIs matched business intent.

## 2. KPI validate with AI & Framework Design (Tableau)

1. Instead of visualizing raw metrics, I focused on decision-oriented KPIs, including:
2. Revenue Growth & Sales Velocity
3. Average Order Value (AOV)
4. Product & Category Contribution
5. Customer Repeat Rate & Behavioral Trends

## 3. Dashboard & Visual Analytics
The Tableau dashboard was designed for multi-level stakeholders:
a. Leadership view: High-level performance summary
b. Business view: Category and product-level trends
c. Operational view: Volume, consistency, and inefficiencies
d. Interactive filters enable root-cause analysis rather than static reporting.

# Key Analytical Insights Generated (VIMP)
## Sales Performance Insights
Revenue concentration is driven by a limited number of high-performing products
Seasonal patterns directly influence sales volume and revenue spikes
Growth is uneven across categories, highlighting expansion and rationalization opportunities

## Customer Behavior Insights
A smaller segment of repeat customers contributes disproportionately to revenue
Purchasing behavior varies significantly by category, impacting pricing and bundling strategies

## Operational & Strategic Insights
Certain products generate high volume but low revenue impact
Underperforming categories dilute overall profitability
Data supports targeted inventory, pricing, and marketing optimization

# Role of AI in the Project
AI functioned as an analytical accelerator, helping to:
a. Generate and optimize SQL queries
b. Validate KPI logic and assumptions
c. Reduce development time while improving analytical precision
d. Enhance alignment between technical metrics and business outcomes
